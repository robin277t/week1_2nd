1. Describe the Problem

    Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

    As a user
    So that I can manage my time
    I want to see an estimate of the reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.

2. Design the Method Signature

    Include the name of the methods, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

    Method called 'read_time'. Takes an argument of a string (only)
    If not nil, and convert to string, will return string.split.length/200 + "minutes", may need a to float conversion?
    no side effects

3. Create Examples as Tests

    Make a list of the examples of what the methods will take and return. Encode each example as a test. You add to the above as you go.
    input "hello" *500 and expect answer to be 2.5 minutes
    input 0 and expect answer to be 0.005 minutes
    input "hello" *200 and expect answer to be 1 minute
    **note the plural of minute(s) (just use m instead)

4. Implement the Behaviour

    After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
