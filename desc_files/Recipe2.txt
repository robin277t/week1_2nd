1. Describe the Problem

    Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

    

2. Design the Class interface

    The design of its initializer and the parameters it takes.
    
    The design of its public methods, including:
        Their names and purposes
        What parameters they take and the data types.
        What they return and that data type
        Any other side effects they might have
    

3. Create Examples as Tests

    Make a list of the examples of what the methods will take and return. Encode each example as a test. You add to the above as you go.

4. Implement the Behaviour

    After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
