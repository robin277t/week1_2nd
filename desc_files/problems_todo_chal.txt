1. Describe the Problem

    Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

    as a user
    so that i can keep track of my tasks
    i want to check if a string includes the string #todo

2. Design the Method Signature

    Include the name of the methods, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

    method named todo_checker, takes a string as an argument
    returns a fail message if no string or blank string is input
    otherwise, use string.include? and then the substring #TODO in upcase to return true or false

3. Create Examples as Tests

    Make a list of the examples of what the methods will take and return. Encode each example as a test. You add to the above as you go.

    test 1: fail message if string input is ""
    test 2: input "this is a string" => false
    test 3: input "#todo this task dude" => false
    test 4: input "#TODO this task dude" => true
    test 5: input "this task will need a #TODO my friend" => true


4. Implement the Behaviour

    After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
