1. Describe the Problem

    Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

2. Design the Method Signature

    Include the name of the methods, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

3. Create Examples as Tests

    Make a list of the examples of what the methods will take and return. Encode each example as a test. You add to the above as you go.

4. Implement the Behaviour

    After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
