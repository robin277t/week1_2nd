1. Describe the Problem

    Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.
    As a user
    So that I can improve my grammar
    I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter 
    and ends with a suitable sentence-ending punctuation  mark.

2. Design the Method Signature

    Include the name of the methods, its parameters, return value, and side effects.
    method called grammer_check. takes a string as an argument
    checks that string[0] is upcase and string[-1] in (. ! ?)
    returns true if both above are true, else false

3. Create Examples as Tests

    Make a list of the examples of what the methods will take and return. Encode each example as a test. You add to the above as you go.
    text "hello there sir!" is false
    text "Hello there sir" is false
    text "Hello there sir?" is true
    text "Hello There Sire!" is true
    text "hello there sir." is false


4. Implement the Behaviour

    After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
